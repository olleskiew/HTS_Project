## Introduction:

Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field, and analyses performed even a decade ago may yield different results when the same datasets are processed with current tools. In this project, we tried to replicate the results from the study [*Rab25 Is a Tumor Suppressor Gene with Anti‑angiogenic and Anti‑invasive Activities in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma*](https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/72/22/6024/577982/Rab25-Is-a-Tumor-Suppressor-Gene-with)\[1\] from 2011*.* We wanted to see whether we would obtain similar results and if we could extract even more information from the data. Unfortunately, the exact workflow (code) used in the original study is not available, which proved how important it is to make scientific studies reproducible for future researchers.

The article we chose focuses on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most common types of esophageal cancer, which is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rates. This cancer develops from the squamous cells lining the esophagus and is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The study showed down-regulation of *Rab25* in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Lower expression levels of this gene were associated with reduced overall survival of patients.

In the paper, high‑throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA‑Seq) was used to identify differentially expressed genes between tumour and non‑tumour samples. From what we could find in the article, the first step of the workflow was RNA‑Seq library preparation and sequencing on an Illumina platform, followed by mapping the reads to a human reference genome. The authors then quantified transcript expression levels (counts per gene) and performed statistical analyses to identify differentially expressed genes between tumour and non‑tumour samples. After these steps, the authors carried out wet-lab validation experiments, which were not the focus of our work.

For our project, we used reads from [**BioProject PRJNA147913**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA147913), which were uploaded to the SRA archive in 2011, along with the human reference genome [**GRCh38.p14**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001405.40/) from NCBI.

## Downloading data

As always, first step of analysis is downloading the data. We decided to use reads from BioProject PRJNA147913, due to the fact this reads were uploaded into SRA archive in 2011. We obtained run info from this project and then isolated SRR ids.\[2\]

```{bash}
#|eval: false 
source /home/lesol/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio

esearch -db sra -query PRJNA147913 | efetch -format runinfo > runinfo.csv
cat runinfo.csv | cut -f 1 -d ',' | grep SRR | head > runids.txt

conda deactivate 
```

Next, the list of SRR ids were used with command parallel to download raw reads from SRA archive. To learn how commend parallel works we used tutorial \[3\]

```{bash}
source /home/lesol/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio

mkdir -p data
cat runids.txt | parallel -j 4 fasterq-dump -e 2 --split-files -O data {}

conda deactivate 
```

Then we moved one to downloading human reference genome from NCBI. \[4\] \[5\] \[6\]

```{bash}
source /home/lesol/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio
mkdir -p reference
cd reference

datasets download genome accession GCF_000001405.40 --filename GRCh38_p14.zip --include genome,gff3,gtf

conda deactivate
```

```{bash}
source /home/lesol/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio
cd reference/GRCh38_p14

md5sum --check md5sum.txt

conda deactivate
```

md5sum showed that the file was not corrupted during transfer

## Quality Control

We decided to perform quality control check with two tools: FastQC and MultiQC. While FastQC generates one report per sample the MultiQC software groups any FastQC output into single report.

```{bash}
source /home/lesol/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio

mkdir -p QC_1/multiqc
fastqc -q -o QC_1/ data/*.fastq
multiqc -q -o QC_1/multiqc QC_1/

conda deactivate
```

The quality control showed some interesting aspects of data:

-   All Samples had adapters removed before uploading them to SRA archive

-   There is high level of duplication

-   Two samples - SRR349743 and SR349745 have bad sequence per tile quality. The probable cause is an air bubble - due to this read some parts of chip was not read correctly

-   All samples have warnings related to the 'Per sequence GC content' module. There is possibility of contamination with rRNA.

Unfortunately we are unable to do anything with these problems, only to take them into consideration when analyzing the data.

<figure style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">

<img src="plots/figure1.png" alt="A" style="width:100%; max-width:900px; height:350px; object-fit:contain; display:block; margin:auto;"/>

<figcaption style="text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-top:6px;">

figure 1: This plot shows status for each FastQC section showing whether results seem entirely normal (green), slightly abnormal (orange) or very unusual (red). We are able to see that per base sequence content, per sequence GC content, sequence duplication levels and overrepressented sequences are abnormal or very unusual.

</figure>

<figure style="margin: 0 0 16px 0;">

<img src="plots/figure2.png" alt="B" style="width:100%; max-width:900px; height:350px; object-fit:contain; display:block; margin:auto;"/>

<figcaption style="text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-top:6px;">

figure 2: This plot shows per sequence GC-content. We may see that it's shape is similar to normal distribution. Unfortunately the sharp peak is observed near 58–60% GC and have wide tail around 30–50% GC. She sharp peak may indicate duplicated sequences

</figcaption>

</figure>

<figure style="margin: 0;">

<img src="plots/figure3.png" alt="C" style="width:100%; max-width:900px; height:350px; object-fit:contain; display:block; margin:auto;"/>

<figcaption style="text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-top:6px;">

figure 3: On this plot we are able to see duplicates level of sequences. Multiple specific sequences are repeatedly detected across most samples (often 8–12/12 reports), each contributing up to \~0.7% of all reads, while the Adapter Content remains near zero. This pattern is consistent with RNA-seq libraries dominated by highly expressed transcripts and/or residual rRNA

</figcaption>

</figure>

Data for our project was published in 2011, so looking at individual samples we may observe characteristic curve for older reads with Illumina.

</figure>

<figure style="margin: 0;">

<img src="plots/figure4.png" alt="C" style="width:100%; max-width:900px; height:350px; object-fit:contain; display:block; margin:auto;"/>

<figcaption style="text-align:center; font-weight:600; margin-top:6px;">

figure 4: This plot shows mean quality score of all samples. The quality drops at the end, which is typical for old RNA-seq data. The sample SR349745 have the worst quality of the set which is consisted with bad sequence per tile quality we observed earlier.

</figcaption>

</figure>

We decided to not trim our samples with Cutadapt, due to the fact that all adapters were removed prior to uploading files into SRA archive. This means this samples where probably used for analysis from the article. This approach will allow us to compere our results better.

Full MultiQC report is available on github repository \[7\]

## Mapping

We decided to use Bowtie2 for mapping reads to our reference genome.

Mapping consist of two steps:

1.  indexing genome
2.  mapping reads to the reference using parallel

```{bash}
source /home/lesol/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio

cd reference/GRCh38_p14/ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_000001405.40

bowtie2-build --threads 12 GCF_000001405.40_GRCh38.p14_genomic.fna B_ref_indx #building index

conda deactivate
```

```{bash}
source /home/lesol/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio

mkdir -p Bowtie_aligment
mkdir -p Bowtie_aligment Bowtie_aligment/parallel_logs

#Mapping
parallel -j 4 --results Bowtie_aligment/parallel_logs \
  bowtie2 -x reference/GRCh38_p14/ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_000001405.40/B_ref_indx \
  -U {} --threads 3 \
  -S Bowtie_aligment/{/.}.sam \
  ::: data/*.fastq



```

### Sorting and indexing bam files

The final step in processing the mapping files was sorting and indexing the files using the samtools program.

```{bash}
source /Users/tomek/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda activate bio

mkdir -p mapped/parallel_logs

parallel -j 4 --results mapped/parallel_logs \
  "samtools view -b {} |
  samtools sort -o mapped/{/.}_sorted.bam && samtools index mapped/{/.}_sorted.bam" \
::: Bowtie_aligment/*.sam
```

## Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis

### DESeq2

For the differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, we applied the **DESeq2** package (version 1.50.2), which is the current publication standard. DESeq2 utilizes a Negative Binomial generalized linear model, which accounts for the overdispersed nature of discrete sequencing counts. To improve the reliability of the results, the package applies dispersion shrinkage to stabilize variance estimation - a crucial step for experiments with limited biological replicates.

We started by downloading the Series Matrix File corresponding to the previously downloaded dataset.

```{r}
library(GEOquery)
gse <- getGEO("GSE32424", GSEMatrix=TRUE)
```

The downloaded file was used to compile a metadata table.

```{r}
raw_metadata <- gse[["GSE32424_series_matrix.txt.gz"]]@phenoData@data[["characteristics_ch1"]]
group_names <- gsub(".*: ", "", raw_metadata)
groups <- as.factor(group_names)
metadata <- pData(phenoData(gse[[1]]))[c('geo_accession','characteristics_ch1')]
metadata$characteristics_ch1 <- gsub(".*: ", "", metadata$characteristics_ch1)
metadata <- data.frame(metadata, row.names = 1)
metadata
```

The file did not contain Run IDs from the SRA database, hence we used the rentrez package to convert GSM IDs.

```{r}
library(rentrez)
gsm_to_srr <- function(gsm_id) {
  search_res <- entrez_search(db = "sra", term = gsm_id)
  info <- entrez_summary(db = "sra", id = search_res$ids)
  srr_id <- gsub(".*acc=\"([^\"]+)\".*", "\\1", info$runs)
  return(srr_id)
}

rownames(metadata) <- sapply(rownames(metadata), gsm_to_srr)
metadata
```

### **DESeqDataSet (DDS)**

The previously obtained BAM files were processed to generate a count matrix, which was then used to construct a DDS object. This object integrates the raw count data with the experimental metadata and the design formula required for downstream statistical analysis.

```{r}
library(Rsubread)

bam_files <- list.files("mapped", pattern = "_sorted.bam$", full.names = TRUE)
gtf_path <- 'reference/GRCh38_p14/ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_000001405.40/genomic.gtf'

counts <- featureCounts(files = bam_files,
                        annot.ext = gtf_path,
                        isGTFAnnotationFile = TRUE,
                        GTF.featureType = "exon",
                        GTF.attrType = "gene_id",
                        isPairedEnd = F,
                        nthreads = 4,
                        allowMultiOverlap = T)
```

```{r}
count_matrix <- counts$counts
colnames(count_matrix) <- gsub("_sorted.bam", "", colnames(count_matrix))
```

```{r}
library(DESeq2)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = count_matrix, colData = metadata, design= ~ characteristics_ch1)
dds <- DESeq(dds)
```

### PCA

To assess the similarity within biological repetition groups and the differences between groups, we used PCA.

```{r}
norm_counts <- DESeq2::counts(dds, normalized = T)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

to_PCA <- norm_counts %>% t()
pca <- prcomp(to_PCA)

pca_metadata <- metadata %>% tibble::rownames_to_column(var ="SAMPLE")

pca_plot <-
  as.data.frame(pca$x) %>%
  tibble::rownames_to_column(var ="SAMPLE") %>%
  left_join(pca_metadata, by = "SAMPLE")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(pca_plot)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = PC1,y = PC2,col = characteristics_ch1),size = 3)+
  labs(x = percentage_variance_explained[1],y = percentage_variance_explained[2])
```

The plot shows a clear separation of groups along the first principal component (PC1). Tumor samples (blue) are clustered on the left side of the 0 axis, while non-tumor samples (red) are clustered on the right. This arrangement indicates a strong biological signal — the difference between tumor and healthy tissue is the main factor differentiating these samples.

### Volcano plot

Finally, we created a volcano plot illustrating gene up- and downregulation.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

dds_results <- results(dds, contrast = c("characteristics_ch1","tumor","non-tumor"), alpha = 0.01)
dds_results <- as.data.frame(dds_results)

ggplot(dds_results)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=log2FoldChange, y=-log10(padj)))+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(-2,2),linetype = "dotted")
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
downregulated <- row.names(filter(dds_results, padj < 0.01, log2FoldChange < -2))
upregulated <- row.names(filter(dds_results, padj < 0.01, log2FoldChange > 2))
```

We filtered by standard values:

-   down-regulated genes (padj \< 0.01, log2FoldChange \< -2)

-   up-regulated genes (padj \< 0.01, log2FoldChange \> 2).

We obtained a list of 301 downregulated genes and 393 upregulated genes.

## Statistics comparison with the article

```{r}

names <- c("Current study", "Tong, Man et al.")
Values <- c(sum(rowSums(counts(dds)) > 0), 14351)

barplot(Values, main = 'Number of represented genes', names.arg = names, ylab = 'Number of genes', col = 'steelblue2')
```

```{r}
Values <- c(sum(rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10)/nrow(counts(dds))*100, 42)
barplot(Values, main = '% of the total number of genes in the reference database \n with at least 10 exon reads', names.arg = names, ylab = '%', col = 'steelblue2', ylim = c(0, 100))
```

Despite using a newer genome annotation (GRCh38.p14 (2025) vs NCBI buid 37.1 (2009)), our results remained highly consistent with the original study. This suggests that the core transcriptional signature of the dataset is stable and not significantly affected by recent updates.

```{r}
colors = c('tomato2', "steelblue2")
names <- c("Current study", "Tong, Man et al.")
regions <- c("Down-regulated", "Up-regulated")

Values <- matrix(c(length(downregulated), 132,
                   length(upregulated), 1598),
                nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

barplot(Values, main = "Number of detected Differentially Expressed Genes", names.arg = names,
                        ylab = "Number of genes",
                        col = colors, beside = TRUE)

legend("topleft", regions, cex = 0.7, fill = colors)
```

## Functional analysis (GO terms)

### DAVID

As there were problems with RDAVIDWebService R library (it was unavailable) and DAVID API (could not esablish connection), we decided to perform analysis in DAVID manually (which we know is a bad practice due to limited reproducibility). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed separately for upregulated and downregulated genes.

The steps taken (analogically for downregulated genes):

1.  Go to <https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov/tools.jsp>
2.  **Step 1: Enter Gene List** -`B:Choose From a File` "up.txt"
3.  **Step 2: Select Identifier** - `OFFICIAL_GENE_SYMBOL`
4.  **Step 2a: Select species** - `Homo sapiens`
5.  **Step 3: List Type** - `Gene List`
6.  **Step 4: Submit List**
7.  **Functional Annotation Tool** (save every chart a CSV file for easier plotting)
    -   **-\> Gene_Ontology** -\> `GOTERM BP DIRECT` -\> `CHART` -\> EASE Threshold: 0.01, Count Threshold: 10
    -   **-\> Gene_Ontology** -\> `GOTERM CC DIRECT` -\> `CHART` -\> EASE Threshold: 0.01, Count Threshold: 10
    -   **-\> Gene_Ontology** -\> `GOTERM MF DIRECT` -\> `CHART` -\> EASE Threshold: 0.01, Count Threshold: 10
    -   **-\> Pathways** -\> `KEGG PATHWAY` -\> `CHART` -\> EASE Threshold: 0.01, Count Threshold: 10

Figure 5: Plots created with code above from data generated with DAVID. All plots except the last one display the 5 terms with the highest enrichment. Higher-quality versions are available on our GitHub.

Most enriched biological processes among upregulated genes are associated with cancer. Among the KEGG pathways, the metabolic pathway is noticeably enriched in downregulated genes, while cancer-related pathways are common in upregulated genes. Interestingly, protein binding is the most enriched molecular function in both upregulated and downregulated genes.

Figure 6: Plots created using enrichGO and visualised with enrichplot. All plots except the last one display the 10 terms with the highest enrichment. Higher-quality versions are available on our GitHub.

Among upregulated genes, most enriched ones were connected to extracellular matrix. Interestingly, downregulated Biological Processes were clearly connected to squamous carcinoma.

### Comparison with the article

In the article it is said that pathway enrichment analysis "found the deregulated genes to be commonly associated with a number of cancer-related pathways". Two most enriched pathways were related to integrin signaling.

In our analysis with DAVID, we also observed that the deregulated genes are associated with cancer. However, we did not find evidence supporting their specific involvement in integrin signaling.

Interestingly, using enrichGO, we found that upregulated genes are associated with integrin binding in molecular functions and with the integrin-mediated signaling pathway in biological processes.

DAVID and enrichGO returned different GO terms, but in both cases the results matched the findings from the article. DAVID and enrichGO work diferently: DAVID uses predefined gene sets and clusters to give a more general view, while enrichGO tests each GO term statistically and is more precise. Using both tools made the analysis more complete in our view.

# HTS_Project
This repository contains files related to the final project for HTS class at Jagiellonian Univeristy.
The project was completed in January, 2026.

## About project:
The main goal of our final project was to verify whether replication of publicly available, aged RNA-seq data with tools available at the moment could yield new information.

## Used data:
For our project we decided to use reads from BioProject PRJNA147913, due to the fact that these reads were uploaded into SRA archive in 2011. We also used human reference genome: GRCh38.p14 from NCBI.

### Versions of used tools and packages:

entrez-direct 24.0  
fasterq-dump : 3.2.1  
md5sum (GNU coreutils): 9.4  
bowtie2-align-s version: 2.5.4  
STAR: 2.7.11b
